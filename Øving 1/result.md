When calling a computation, the computer goes through a "read-modify-write" process. First we read the computation call, e.g. we read that i should be incremented. Then we modify i, i.e. actually performing the incrementation of i. If we then read a decrementation during modify, before the result of the incrementation gets written, we will do the decrementation instead of incrementing in the modify stage. If the modification is done before a new read stage, the result gets written. Or, in some cases the cimputation calls can be read simultaneously, and the computer chooses a random operation to execute (either incrementation or decrementation). Either way, the program effectively jumps one iteration of incrementation or decrementation, and in total we will get a number not equal to zero, meaning that we have jumped more incrementations if negative, or more decrementations if positive.
